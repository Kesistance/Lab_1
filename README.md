âš¡ Fun fact: 
A sergeant was preparing his unit for a visit from an inspecting colonel:
-The colonel usually asks three questions: -How old are you? How long have you been in the military? What is your favourite part of life, military or civilian? ' Your answers should be, 'Twenty years,' 'Six months,' and 'Both.' Keep these answers in your head.
On the appointed day the colonel arrived and, going round the line of soldiers, addressed one of them:
-How long have you been in the service?
-Twenty years, sir.
-How old are you?
-Six months.
The colonel leaned towards the soldier and asked quietly, in a friendly manner:
-"Whose head is out of order, do you think, yours or mine?
-"One or the other.
